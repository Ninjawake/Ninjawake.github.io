<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me - Richie S.</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana">Go big or go home, that is the mindset which I have in mind with my career goals. I’ve always been fascinated about computers and their inner workings, as well as how we were able to go from bashing rocks into stone tools, to using specially designed and built rocks that function with electricity and can access information seemingly out of thin air. Computers are something I am both intrigued and interested in. Additionally, this will help me live a pretty good life.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-family:verdana">In my work, I have been accurate, decisive and dependable especially through my mathematical works. I can cooperate with others and be as friendly as I can to achieve a common goal or ending. I often pursue helping others and really expect nothing in exchange, but simply out of human bond. I have participated in Asian Student Association’s meetings along with the Badminton Club. A good achievement I have is ending freshman year with all A’s.</p2>

<p style="font-family:verdana">Through my cooperation as previously mentioned, I’ve demonstrated my dependability as our team works together to make this 1st place vegetable soup in International Cuisine.</p3>
<br>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I’ve learned that I also can do more than what I think I can. Through my studies, harder classes allowed me to study better and adapt to its difficulties. This has also happened in work, with me remembering almost perfectly about my job when pushed onto me. Not to mention, I optimize my work to the best of my ability to reduce energy on how it’s spent. Efficiency is key in my world, and I apply this to mostly everything.</p4>
<br>
<p style="font-family:verdana">Altogether, I am a cooperative nice student, who just does his best and makes the most of what he has. I thank you for your time reading and learning more about me. Please feel free to look around my site and check it out further.</p5>
