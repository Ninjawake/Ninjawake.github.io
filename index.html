<h1>About Me - Richie S.</h1>
<p>Go big or go home, is the mindset I have with my career goals. I’ve always been fascinated about computers and their workings, and how we were able to go from bashing rocks, to using special rocks that function with electricity. It’s a big interest of mine which I’d like to understand and enjoy along the way. Plus, this will help me live a pretty good life.</p>
<p2>In my work, I have been accurate, decisive and dependable through my mathematical works. I can cooperate with others and be as friendly as I can to achieve a common goal. Helping others is something I pursue often, and doing as much as I can. I have participated in Asian Student Association’s meetings along with the Badminton Club. A good achievement I have is ending freshman year with all A’s.</p2>
<p3>Here is a soup that I made with my group, which won us first place in the class.</p3>
<p4>I’ve learned that I also can do more than what I think I can. Through my studies, harder classes allowed me to study better and adapt to its difficulties. This has also happened in work, with me remembering almost perfectly about my job when pushed onto me. Not to mention, I optimize my work to the best of my ability to reduce energy on how it’s spent. Efficiency is key in my world, and I apply this to mostly everything.</p4>
<p5>Altogether, I am a cooperative nice student, who just does his best and makes the most of what he has. I thank you for your time reading and learning more about me. Please feel free to look around my site and check it out further.</p5>
